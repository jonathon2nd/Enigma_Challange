This is some old files from when I deploied a wifi router and ran the challanged that way.
The goal was for students to crack the wifi security, and intercept packets. 
Then they could take those packets, and try to get ciphers out of them to decrypt.

This was a bit ambitious, and only ever partialy worked.
