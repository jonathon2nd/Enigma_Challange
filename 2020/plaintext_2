Good job making it this far. Due to the nature of the text after it has been processoed by the machine. Processing is nessesary to make it easer to read. Like replacing 'x' with spaces, or some number of 'x' with newlines, whatever works for you.

We know most of the plugboard: LO KI JU HY GT FR DE SW QA, but we do not know what the last pair is.
We know that rotors I, II, and III are used, but we don't know what order.
We don't know what reflector is being used.
We know two of ring settings D J, but we don't know what order they are in. We do not know what the third ring setting is, or what order it is with the know two.
