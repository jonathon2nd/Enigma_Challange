Each challange has a codeword or phrase to get points for doing the challange.
A machine configuration cna be thought of as a key

Challange 1: simple cipher
	Output: hints for the machine/key for challange 2
	The passphrase: Read 'Em and Weep
	Key from codebook: 1

Challange 2: simple cipher
	Output: hints for the machine/key for challange 3
	The passphrase: Short End of the Stick
	Key from codebook: 3

Challange 3: long cipher
	The passphrase: Elvis Has Left The Building
	Key from codebook: 5

Challange 4: hard cipher
	Output: a very long codebook, which one of them is the needed machine/key to solve challange 5
	The passphrase: On the Ropes
	Key from codebook: 7

Challange 5: very hard cipher
	Challange 5 gives no hints, and can only be solved with the decrypted codebook from solving challange 4
	The final passphrase: Don't Count Your Chickens Before They Hatch
	Key from codebook: From long list that is plaintext_4_codebook. Going to add it to the codebook for easy use, 20
