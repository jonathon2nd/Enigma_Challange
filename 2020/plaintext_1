Wow, great job! you will find that many chars are stripped from these messages, like numbers and symbols.
Also, lucky you, there are no xs used in any of these machines. You can think of these configuration of the enigma machine as the 'key' to break the cipher.
You will also want to know that this cipher is symetric, becasue the same enigma machine configuration is used to decypt a message that has ben encrypted.

So, what happens next? You need to decrypt the next message.
Here is a hint:
We know the plugboard: QZ WX EC RV TB YN UM IK OL PA
We know that rotors I, II, and III are used, but we don't know what order.
We don't know what reflector is being used.
We know the ring settings F O M, but we don't know what order they are in.

Passphrase for this level:  Read 'Em and Weep
