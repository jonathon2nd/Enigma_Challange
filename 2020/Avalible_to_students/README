Oh no! The Wehrmacht is back! They are now equiped with modern technology, but they are still using their enigma machines.
There are encrypted messages that contain information we need to know, for reasons.

A python2 template to get you started: template.py
There is also a test file for you to try out. When you test it out it should look like the following.

$ python template.py < test

$ python template.py < test > output

You will need to install the enigma package

Important Note: there is a possible bug with machine.set_display(), set the ring setting instead.

Each ciphertext has a passphrase that will get you points, and ciphertext are to be solved in order numerically.



Now, lets get started with the challange:
You need to first decypt ciphertext_1.
The ring settings are: A A A
The plugboard setting are: AB CD EF GH IJ KL MN OP QR ST
We know that rotors I, II, and III are used, but we don't know what order.
The reflector used is B


Note: There are rules that govern the confiuration of an enigma machine
For example: a rotor can not be used more than once.
There are more rules than this one. When you understand how the enigma machine works, they should become evident.
